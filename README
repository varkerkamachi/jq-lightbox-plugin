jQuery Plugin: Ninjabox: README

This is a very simple plugin. Based off jQuery. The default options are width, height, source and media type. These can be extended.

Width: media width
Height: media height
Source: specifies the url for the video or path to the image
Media type: image or video

Styling of the lightbox is done with CSS. 

The effect is called on an element like an anchor tag and triggered by an onclick event.

There is only one method "hide()" within the plugin. Can be called: "$.fn.ninjaBox.hide();"
